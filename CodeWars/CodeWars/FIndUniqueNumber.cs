         Caution: This kata does not currently have any known supported versions for C#. It may not be completable due to dependencies on out-dated libraries/language versions.
         There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

        findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
        findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
        It’s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 numbers.

        The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

        This is the first kata in series:

        Find the unique number (this kata)
        Find the unique string
        Find The Unique
         
        */

        public int GetUnique(IEnumerable<int> numbers)
        {
            return numbers.GroupBy(item => item).FirstOrDefault(item=>item.Count()==1).Key;
        }





    }
}
